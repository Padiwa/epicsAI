# Implement Basic API Gateway Metrics

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic metrics for the API gateway so that we can track the performance and usage of the API.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `prometheus/client_golang` package for metrics collection. Implement metrics for the API gateway and ensure that metrics are properly exposed and configured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Metrics for the API gateway are set up and configured
- Metrics are properly collected and exposed
- Metrics improve API performance monitoring and debugging
- Metrics are integrated with the application's monitoring and alerting systems
