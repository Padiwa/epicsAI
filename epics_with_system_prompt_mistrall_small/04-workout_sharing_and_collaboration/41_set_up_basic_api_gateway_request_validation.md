# Set Up Basic API Gateway Request Validation

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic request validation for the API gateway so that we can ensure the correctness and security of API requests.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` package for request validation. Implement validation middleware for the API gateway and ensure that validation is properly enforced and configured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Request validation for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Validation is properly enforced and applied to API requests
- Request validation improves API security and data integrity
- Request validation is integrated with the application's API gateway and monitoring systems
