# Set Up Go Project Structure

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up a well-organized Go project structure so that we have a solid foundation for the application development.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use a standard Go project layout with clear separation of concerns. Consider using modules for dependency management. Organize the project with directories like `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, and `api/`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project structure follows Go best practices
- Modules are properly initialized (`go mod init`)
- Basic directory structure is in place
- Project builds without errors
