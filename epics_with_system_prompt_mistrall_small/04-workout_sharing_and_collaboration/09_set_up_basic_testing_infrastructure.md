# Set Up Basic Testing Infrastructure

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up a basic testing infrastructure so that we can ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `testing` package for writing unit tests. Implement table-driven tests for common scenarios. Consider using the `stretchr/testify` package for additional assertion and mocking capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Basic test structure is in place
- Unit tests are written for critical components
- Tests can be run using standard Go commands (`go test`)
- Test coverage is measured and reported
