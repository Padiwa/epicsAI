# Implement Workout Creation and Management

**Description:** As a user, I want to create and manage my workouts so that I can organize my fitness routine.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `net/http` package for HTTP handling. Implement RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting workouts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create new workouts
- Users can view their workouts
- Users can update their workouts
- Users can delete their workouts
- Workout management endpoints are secure and follow RESTful principles
