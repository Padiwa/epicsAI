# Implement Basic API Gateway Request Retry

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic request retry for the API gateway so that we can improve API resilience to transient failures.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/avast/retry-go` package for request retry. Implement retry logic for the API gateway and ensure that retries are properly configured and managed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Request retry for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Retries are properly applied to API requests
- Request retry improves API resilience
- Request retry is integrated with the application's API gateway and monitoring systems
