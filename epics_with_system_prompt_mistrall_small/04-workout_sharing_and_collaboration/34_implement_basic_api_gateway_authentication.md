# Implement Basic API Gateway Authentication

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic authentication for the API gateway so that we can secure API access and ensure that only authorized users can access the API.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` package for JWT-based authentication. Implement authentication middleware for the API gateway and ensure that authentication is properly enforced and configured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Authentication for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Authentication is properly enforced and applied to API requests
- Authentication improves API security
- Authentication is integrated with the application's API gateway and user management systems
