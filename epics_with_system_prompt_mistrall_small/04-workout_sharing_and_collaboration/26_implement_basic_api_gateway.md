# Implement Basic API Gateway

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement a basic API gateway so that we can manage API routing and load balancing.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` router for API routing. Implement load balancing and proxying for downstream services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API gateway is implemented and configured
- API routing is properly managed
- Load balancing is implemented for downstream services
- API gateway is integrated with the application's API design
