# Implement Basic API Versioning

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic API versioning so that we can manage API changes over time.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use URL path-based versioning (e.g., `/v1/workouts`). Implement versioning in the API router and ensure backward compatibility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API versioning is implemented and consistent
- API versions are properly documented
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- API versioning is integrated with the application's API design
