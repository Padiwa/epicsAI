# Set Up Basic Monitoring and Metrics

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic monitoring and metrics so that we can track the performance and health of the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `prometheus/client_golang` package for metrics collection. Implement endpoints for exposing metrics. Consider using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Metrics are collected and exposed
- Metrics include basic application health and performance indicators
- Metrics are visualized in a monitoring dashboard
- Alerts are set up for critical metrics
