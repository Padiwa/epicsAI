# Create User Profile Management

**Description:** As a user, I want to create and manage my profile so that I can share my workout information with others.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use GORM for database operations. Define a `User` model with fields like `ID`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `Name`, `Bio`, and `ProfilePictureURL`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create and update their profiles
- Profile information is stored in the database
- Profile information can be retrieved and displayed
- Profile updates are validated for correctness
