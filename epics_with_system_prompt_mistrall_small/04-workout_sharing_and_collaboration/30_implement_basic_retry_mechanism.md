# Implement Basic Retry Mechanism

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement a basic retry mechanism so that we can improve the application's resilience to transient failures.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/avast/retry-go` package for retrying operations. Implement retry logic for downstream service calls and database operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Retry mechanism is implemented and configured
- Retries are properly managed and triggered
- Retry logic improves application resilience
- Retry mechanism is integrated with the application's components
