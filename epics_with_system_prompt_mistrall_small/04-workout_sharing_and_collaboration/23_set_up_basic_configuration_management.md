# Set Up Basic Configuration Management

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic configuration management so that we can manage application configuration efficiently.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `viper` package for configuration management. Load configuration from environment variables, config files, and command-line arguments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configuration management is set up and configured
- Configuration is loaded from multiple sources
- Configuration is properly validated and defaulted
- Configuration is integrated with the application's components
