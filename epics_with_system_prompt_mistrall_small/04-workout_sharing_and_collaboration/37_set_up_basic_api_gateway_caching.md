# Set Up Basic API Gateway Caching

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic caching for the API gateway so that we can improve API performance and reduce load on downstream services.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/patrickmn/go-cache` package for caching. Implement caching middleware for the API gateway and ensure that caching is properly configured and managed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Caching for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Caching is properly applied to API requests and responses
- Caching improves API performance
- Caching is integrated with the application's API gateway and monitoring systems
