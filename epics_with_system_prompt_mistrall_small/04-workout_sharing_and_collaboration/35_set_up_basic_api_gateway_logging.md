# Set Up Basic API Gateway Logging

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic logging for the API gateway so that we can track and debug API requests and responses.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `log` package or a structured logging library like `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` for logging. Implement logging middleware for the API gateway and ensure that logs are properly formatted and include relevant context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logging for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Logs are properly formatted and include relevant context
- Logging improves API debugging and monitoring
- Logging is integrated with the application's monitoring and alerting systems
