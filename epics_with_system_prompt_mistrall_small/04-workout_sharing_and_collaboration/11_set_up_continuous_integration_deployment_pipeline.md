# Set Up Continuous Integration/Deployment Pipeline

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline so that we can automate testing and deployment of the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Implement workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application. Consider using Docker for containerization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CI/CD pipeline is set up and configured
- Pipeline runs automatically on code changes
- Pipeline includes building, testing, and deployment steps
- Deployment artifacts are properly versioned and stored
