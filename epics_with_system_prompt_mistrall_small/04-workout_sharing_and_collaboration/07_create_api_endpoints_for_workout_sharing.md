# Create API Endpoints for Workout Sharing

**Description:** As a user, I want to interact with the workout sharing functionality through API endpoints so that I can integrate it with other applications if needed.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/go-chi/chi/v5` router for handling HTTP requests. Implement RESTful endpoints for sharing, accepting, and rejecting workout shares.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoints for sharing workouts are implemented
- API endpoints for accepting/rejecting shares are implemented
- API endpoints are secure and follow RESTful principles
- API responses are properly formatted and documented
