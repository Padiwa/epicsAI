# Implement Basic API Gateway Load Balancing

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic load balancing for the API gateway so that we can distribute API traffic evenly across downstream services and improve API availability and scalability.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/avast/retry-go` package for load balancing. Implement load balancing logic for the API gateway and ensure that load balancing is properly configured and managed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Load balancing for the API gateway is set up and configured
- Load balancing is properly applied to API requests
- Load balancing improves API availability and scalability
- Load balancing is integrated with the application's API gateway and monitoring systems
