# Set Up Basic Service Discovery

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic service discovery so that we can manage service communication dynamically.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/hashicorp/consul/api` package for service discovery. Implement service registration and discovery for the application's components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Service discovery is set up and configured
- Services are properly registered and discovered
- Service discovery is integrated with the application's components
- Service discovery improves resilience and scalability
