# Implement Basic Error Handling and Logging

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement robust error handling and logging so that we can monitor the application and quickly resolve issues.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `log` package for basic logging. Implement custom error handling middleware for HTTP requests. Consider using structured logging libraries like `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` for more advanced logging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application logs important events and errors
- HTTP requests are properly handled and logged
- Custom error responses are returned for API endpoints
- Logs are formatted consistently and include relevant context
