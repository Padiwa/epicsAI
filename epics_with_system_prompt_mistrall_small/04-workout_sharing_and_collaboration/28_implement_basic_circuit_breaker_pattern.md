# Implement Basic Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement the basic circuit breaker pattern so that we can improve the application's resilience.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/sony/gobreaker` package for circuit breaking. Implement circuit breakers for downstream service calls.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Circuit breaker pattern is implemented and configured
- Circuit breakers are properly managed and triggered
- Circuit breakers improve application resilience
- Circuit breakers are integrated with the application's components
