# Implement Basic Caching for Frequently Accessed Data

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic caching for frequently accessed data so that we can improve application performance.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/patrickmn/go-cache` package for in-memory caching. Implement caching for frequently accessed data like user profiles and workouts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Caching is implemented for frequently accessed data
- Cache is properly managed and invalidated
- Caching improves application performance
- Cache configuration is flexible and configurable
