# Implement Basic Request Tracing

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic request tracing so that we can track and debug requests as they flow through the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go` package for request tracing. Implement tracing middleware for API requests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Request tracing is implemented and configured
- Traces are properly managed and propagated
- Traces include relevant context and spans
- Traces are integrated with monitoring and debugging tools
