# Implement Basic User Input Validation

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic user input validation so that we can ensure data integrity and prevent errors.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` package for input validation. Implement validation logic for user registration, login, and workout creation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User input is validated before processing
- Validation errors are properly handled and reported
- Validation rules are consistent and well-defined
- Validation is applied to all relevant API endpoints
