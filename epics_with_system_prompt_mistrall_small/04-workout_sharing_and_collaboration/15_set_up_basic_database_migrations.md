# Set Up Basic Database Migrations

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic database migrations so that we can manage database schema changes over time.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use GORM's migration capabilities or a dedicated migration tool like `golang-migrate/migrate`. Implement migration scripts for initial schema setup and future changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database migrations are set up and configured
- Initial schema is properly migrated
- Migration scripts are versioned and managed
- Migrations can be applied and rolled back as needed
