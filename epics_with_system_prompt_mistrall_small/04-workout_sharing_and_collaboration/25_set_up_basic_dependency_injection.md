# Set Up Basic Dependency Injection

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic dependency injection so that we can manage dependencies efficiently and improve testability.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use a dependency injection framework like `google.gopkg.in/inject` or implement a simple DI container. Manage dependencies for services and repositories.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dependency injection is set up and configured
- Dependencies are properly managed and injected
- DI container is integrated with the application's components
- DI improves testability and maintainability
