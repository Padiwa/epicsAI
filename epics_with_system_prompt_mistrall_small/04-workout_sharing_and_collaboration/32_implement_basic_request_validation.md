# Implement Basic Request Validation

**Description:** As a developer, I want to implement basic request validation so that we can ensure the correctness and security of API requests.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` package for request validation. Implement validation logic for API requests and ensure that validation errors are properly handled and reported.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Request validation is implemented and configured
- Validation rules are properly defined and applied
- Validation errors are properly handled and reported
- Request validation improves application security and data integrity
