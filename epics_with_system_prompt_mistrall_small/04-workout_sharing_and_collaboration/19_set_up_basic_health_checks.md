# Set Up Basic Health Checks

**Description:** As a developer, I want to set up basic health checks so that we can monitor the application's health and availability.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Implement health check endpoints that return the application's status. Use the `net/http/pprof` package for additional debugging endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Health check endpoints are implemented
- Health checks return the application's status
- Health checks are accessible and secure
- Health checks are integrated with monitoring systems
