# Implement Password Reset Functionality
**Description:** Develop a system for users to reset their passwords via email.
**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use a third-party email service like SendGrid or Mailgun for sending reset emails. Implement a secure token-based system for password resets.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Password reset request endpoint is implemented.
- Email with reset link is sent to the user.
- Password reset endpoint is implemented and secure.
- Password is updated upon successful reset.
```

Each of these tasks is designed to be self-contained and actionable, ensuring that the development team can work on them independently and integrate them into the overall system.
