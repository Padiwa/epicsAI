# Design Database Schema for Users
**Description:** Design the database schema for storing user information, including authentication details.
**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use GORM for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify database interactions. Define the User model with fields like ID, username, email, password hash, and created_at.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database schema is designed and documented.
- User model is defined using GORM.
- Schema includes necessary fields for user registration and authentication.
