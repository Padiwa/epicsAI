# Create User Registration API Endpoint
**Description:** Develop an API endpoint for user registration that accepts user details and stores them securely in the database.
**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the Chi router for handling HTTP requests. Validate user input and handle errors appropriately. Use bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoint for user registration is implemented.
- User details are validated and securely stored.
- Passwords are hashed before storage.
- Endpoint returns appropriate success and error responses.
