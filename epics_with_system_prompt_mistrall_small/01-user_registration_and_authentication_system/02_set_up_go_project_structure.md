# Set Up Go Project Structure
**Description:** Initialize a new Go module and set up the basic project structure for the user registration and authentication system.
**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use Go modules for dependency management. Organize the project with a clear directory structure, such as `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, and `api/` to separate concerns.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project is initialized as a Go module.
- Basic directory structure is set up.
- Project builds without errors.
