# Set Up Continuous Integration

**Description:** As a developer, I need to set up continuous integration so that I can automatically test and build the application on each commit.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for setting up the CI pipeline. Implement automated testing and building steps.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CI pipeline is set up and triggered on each commit.
- Pipeline runs unit and integration tests.
- Pipeline builds the application and generates artifacts.
- Pipeline sends notifications on build failures.
