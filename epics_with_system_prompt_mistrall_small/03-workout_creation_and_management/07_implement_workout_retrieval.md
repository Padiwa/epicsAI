# Implement Workout Retrieval

**Description:** As a user, I want to view my existing workouts so that I can keep track of my fitness routine.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use `gorilla/mux` for routing and `gorm` for database operations. Implement pagination for listing workouts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can retrieve a list of their workouts.
- Workouts are displayed with their name, description, and creation date.
- The list of workouts is paginated for better performance.
- Workouts are retrieved from the database.
