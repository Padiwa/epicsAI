# Implement Workout Sharing

**Description:** As a user, I want to share my workouts with other users so that they can benefit from my fitness routines.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use `gorilla/mux` for routing and `gorm` for database operations. Implement a sharing mechanism with proper access control.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can share their workouts with other users.
- Shared workouts are accessible to the intended recipients.
- Sharing is recorded in the database.
- Users can view their shared workouts.
