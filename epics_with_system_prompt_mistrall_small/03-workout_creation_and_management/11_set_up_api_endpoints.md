# Set Up API Endpoints

**Description:** As a developer, I need to set up API endpoints for workout management so that the frontend can interact with the backend.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use `gorilla/mux` for routing and `net/http` for handling HTTP requests. Implement proper middleware for authentication and error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoints are defined for workout creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- Endpoints are secured with JWT authentication.
- Endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- Endpoints are documented with Swagger or similar tools.
