# Implement Workout Update

**Description:** As a user, I want to update my existing workouts so that I can make changes to my fitness routine.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use `gorilla/mux` for routing and `gorm` for database operations. Implement validation for updated workout data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can update the name, description, and exercises of an existing workout.
- Updated workout data is validated before being saved.
- Changes to workouts are saved to the database.
- Updated workouts are associated with the current user.
