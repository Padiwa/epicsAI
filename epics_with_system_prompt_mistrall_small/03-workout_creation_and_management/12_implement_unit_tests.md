# Implement Unit Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I need to write unit tests for the workout management functionality so that I can ensure the reliability of the code.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `testing` package for writing tests and `stretchr/testify` for assertions. Implement mocking for external dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests are written for all major functions and methods.
- Tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.
- Tests are runnable with `go test`.
- Test coverage is reported and monitored.
