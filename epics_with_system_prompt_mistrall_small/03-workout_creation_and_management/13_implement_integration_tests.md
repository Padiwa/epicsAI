# Implement Integration Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I need to write integration tests for the workout management functionality so that I can ensure the components work together correctly.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use the `testing` package for writing tests and `stretchr/testify` for assertions. Implement test databases for isolation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration tests are written for API endpoints and database operations.
- Tests cover the interaction between different components.
- Tests are runnable with `go test`.
- Test coverage is reported and monitored.
