# Implement Workout Creation

**Description:** As a user, I want to create a new workout so that I can plan my fitness routine.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use `gorilla/mux` for routing and `gorm` for database operations. Implement validation for workout data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can create a new workout with a name, description, and exercises.
- Workout data is validated before being saved.
- Created workouts are associated with the current user.
- New workouts are saved to the database.
