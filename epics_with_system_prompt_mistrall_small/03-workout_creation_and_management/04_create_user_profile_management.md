# Create User Profile Management

**Description:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information so that I can keep my details up to date.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use structs to define user models and `gorm` for database operations. Implement CRUD operations for user profiles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can update their profile information (e.g., name, age, fitness goals).
- Users can view their profile information.
- Changes to profile information are saved to the database.
- Profile updates are validated for correctness.
