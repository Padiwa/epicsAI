# Set Up Go Project Structure

**Description:** As a developer, I need a well-organized Go project structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.

**Go-Specific Considerations:** Use a standard Go project layout with directories for `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`, `api`, `models`, and `migrations`. Consider using Go modules for dependency management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project structure follows standard Go conventions.
- All necessary directories and files are created.
- `go.mod` file is initialized with the correct module path.
