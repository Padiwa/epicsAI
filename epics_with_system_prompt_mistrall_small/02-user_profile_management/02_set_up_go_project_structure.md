# Set Up Go Project Structure

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to set up a basic Go project structure to ensure the application is organized and scalable.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use a standard Go project layout with directories for `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`, and `api`.
- Consider using modules for dependency management (`go.mod`).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Project structure is created with necessary directories.
- Basic `go.mod` file is initialized.
- Project can be built and run without errors.
