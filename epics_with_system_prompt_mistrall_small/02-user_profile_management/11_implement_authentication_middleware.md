# Implement Authentication Middleware

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to implement authentication middleware to protect routes.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use JWT for authentication.
- Implement middleware to verify JWT tokens.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Protected routes require a valid JWT token.
- Middleware correctly verifies JWT tokens.
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected.
