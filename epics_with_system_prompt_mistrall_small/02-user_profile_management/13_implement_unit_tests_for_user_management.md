# Implement Unit Tests for User Management

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to implement unit tests for user management to ensure code quality.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the `testing` package for unit tests.
- Use a testing framework like `stretchr/testify` for assertions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests are written for user registration, login, profile retrieval, profile update, and user deletion.
- Tests cover edge cases and error scenarios.
- Tests pass successfully.
