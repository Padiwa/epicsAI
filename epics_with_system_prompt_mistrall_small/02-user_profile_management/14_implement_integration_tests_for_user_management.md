# Implement Integration Tests for User Management

**Description:**
As a developer, I need to implement integration tests for user management to ensure the system works as a whole.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the `testing` package for integration tests.
- Use a testing framework like `stretchr/testify` for assertions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration tests are written for user registration, login, profile retrieval, profile update, and user deletion.
- Tests cover the interaction between different components.
- Tests pass successfully.
