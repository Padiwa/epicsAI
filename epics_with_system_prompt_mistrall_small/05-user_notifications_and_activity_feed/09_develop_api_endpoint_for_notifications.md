# Develop API Endpoint for Notifications

**Description:** As a user, I want to retrieve my notifications through an API endpoint so that I can view them in the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the Chi router for handling HTTP requests.
- Implement a RESTful API endpoint for retrieving notifications.
- Use middleware for authentication and authorization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- An API endpoint for retrieving notifications is implemented.
- The endpoint is protected and requires a valid JWT token.
- Notifications are returned in JSON format with appropriate status codes.
