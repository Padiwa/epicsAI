# Set Up Testing Framework

**Description:** As a developer, I need a testing framework to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the standard `testing` package for writing tests.
- Implement unit tests for models, services, and handlers.
- Use a testing database for integration tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests are written for critical components.
- Integration tests are implemented for API endpoints.
- Tests can be run using the `go test` command.
