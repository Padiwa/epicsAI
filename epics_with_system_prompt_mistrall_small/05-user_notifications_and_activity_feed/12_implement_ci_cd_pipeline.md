# Implement CI/CD Pipeline

**Description:** As a developer, I need a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for setting up the pipeline.
- Include steps for running tests, building the application, and deploying to a staging environment.
- Use Docker for containerization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The CI/CD pipeline is set up and configured.
- Tests are automatically run on each commit.
- The application is automatically built and deployed to a staging environment.
