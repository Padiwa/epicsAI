# Implement Workout Program Model and Database Schema

**Description:** As a user, I want to create and store my workout programs so that I can share them with others.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use GORM to define the WorkoutProgram struct with fields like ID, UserID, Title, Description, and Exercises.
- Establish relationships between User and WorkoutProgram models.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The WorkoutProgram model is defined with necessary fields.
- Database tables for workout programs are created.
- Workout programs can be associated with users.
