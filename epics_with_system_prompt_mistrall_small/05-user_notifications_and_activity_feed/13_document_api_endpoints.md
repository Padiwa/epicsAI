# Document API Endpoints

**Description:** As a developer, I need documentation for the API endpoints to understand their functionality and usage.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use Swagger or similar tools for API documentation.
- Document each endpoint with its purpose, request/response format, and example usage.
- Include authentication requirements for each endpoint.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API documentation is generated and accessible.
- Each endpoint is documented with its purpose and usage.
- Authentication requirements are clearly stated.
