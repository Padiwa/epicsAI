# Set Up Go Project Structure

**Description:** As a developer, I need a well-organized Go project structure to start building the application. This includes setting up the necessary directories and files for a modular and maintainable codebase.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the standard Go project layout as a reference.
- Consider using modules for dependency management.
- Organize the project into packages like `cmd`, `internal`, `pkg`, and `api`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The project structure follows the standard Go layout.
- The `go.mod` file is initialized.
- The project includes basic directories for handlers, models, and services.
