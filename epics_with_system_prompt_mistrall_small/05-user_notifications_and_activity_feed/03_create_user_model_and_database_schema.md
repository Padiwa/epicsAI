# Create User Model and Database Schema

**Description:** As a developer, I need a user model and database schema to store user information securely.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use GORM for ORM and database interactions.
- Define the User struct with fields like ID, Email, PasswordHash, and CreatedAt.
- Set up database migrations using GORM.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The User model is defined with necessary fields.
- Database tables are created and migrated successfully.
- User data can be stored and retrieved from the database.
