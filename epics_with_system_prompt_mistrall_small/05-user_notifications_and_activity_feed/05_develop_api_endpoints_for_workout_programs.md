# Develop API Endpoints for Workout Programs

**Description:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete my workout programs through API endpoints so that I can manage them easily.

**Go-Specific Considerations:**
- Use the Chi router for handling HTTP requests.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on workout programs.
- Use middleware for authentication and authorization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting workout programs are implemented.
- Endpoints are protected and require valid JWT tokens.
- Responses are in JSON format and include appropriate status codes.
