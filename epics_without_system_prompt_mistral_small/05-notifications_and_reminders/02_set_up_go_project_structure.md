# Set Up Go Project Structure
Create a modular Go project structure with clear separation of concerns for notifications and reminders.
- **Go Advice**: Use standard Go project layout (e.g., `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`). Consider using a framework like `fiber` or `gin` for HTTP routing if a web component is needed.
