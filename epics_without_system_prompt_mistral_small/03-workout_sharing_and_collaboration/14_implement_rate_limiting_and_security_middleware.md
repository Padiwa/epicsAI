# Implement Rate Limiting and Security Middleware
Add security middleware to protect against common web vulnerabilities and implement rate limiting.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `github.com/ulule/limiter/v3` package for rate limiting.
- Implement CORS middleware using the `github.com/rs/cors` package.
- Use `github.com/unrolled/secure` for security headers.
