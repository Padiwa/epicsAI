# Set Up Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment of the application.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for CI/CD pipelines.
- Include steps for running tests, building binaries, and deploying to a cloud provider.
- Use `docker` for containerization and `docker-compose` for local development.
