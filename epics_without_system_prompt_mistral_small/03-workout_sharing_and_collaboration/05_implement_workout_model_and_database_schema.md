# Implement Workout Model and Database Schema
Define the workout model and database schema, including fields for workout details, exercises, and sharing settings.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use GORM to define relationships between users and workouts (e.g., one-to-many).
- Include fields for workout name, description, exercises, and sharing permissions.
