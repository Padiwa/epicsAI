# Implement User Authentication System
Develop a user authentication system allowing users to register and log in securely.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `bcrypt` package for password hashing.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management using the `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` package.
- Use the `gorilla/sessions` package for session management if needed.
