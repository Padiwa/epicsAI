# Design User Model and Database Schema
Define the user model and database schema, including fields for user profiles, authentication, and workout data.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use `gorm.io/gorm` for ORM and database interactions.
- Define structs for user models with tags for GORM, such as `gorm:"primaryKey"` for primary keys.
