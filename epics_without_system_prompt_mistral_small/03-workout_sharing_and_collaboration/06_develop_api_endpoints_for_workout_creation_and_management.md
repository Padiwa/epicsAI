# Develop API Endpoints for Workout Creation and Management
Create API endpoints for users to create, read, update, and delete their workouts.

**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use Chi router to define routes like `/workouts`, `/workouts/:id`, etc.
- Implement middleware for authentication using JWT tokens.
- Use GORM for database operations.
