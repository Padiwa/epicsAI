# Create REST API Endpoints for Workouts
Implement CRUD operations for workouts.
- Create endpoints for:
  - GET /workouts (list user's workouts)
  - POST /workouts (create new workout)
  - GET /workouts/:id (get specific workout)
  - PUT /workouts/:id (update workout)
  - DELETE /workouts/:id (delete workout)
- **Go-Specific Advice**: Use Chi (`github.com/go-chi/chi/v5`) or Gin for routing
