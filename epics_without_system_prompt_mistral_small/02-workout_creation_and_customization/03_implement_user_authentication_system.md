# Implement User Authentication System
Develop user registration and login functionality.
- Create user model with fields (ID, Email, PasswordHash, CreatedAt)
- Implement registration endpoint with password hashing (use bcrypt)
- Implement login endpoint with JWT token generation
- **Go-Specific Advice**: Use `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` for password hashing and `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` for JWT
