# Design Workout Data Model
Create the data structure for workouts.
- Define workout schema (ID, UserID, Name, Description, Exercises, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
- Implement exercise schema (ID, WorkoutID, Name, Sets, Reps, Weight, Notes)
- **Go-Specific Advice**: Use structs with proper tags for ORM mapping (consider GORM)
