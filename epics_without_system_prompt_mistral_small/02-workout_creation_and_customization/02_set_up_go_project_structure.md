# Set Up Go Project Structure
Create a modular Go project structure following best practices.
- Use a standard Go module layout (cmd/, internal/, pkg/, etc.)
- Set up Go modules with `go mod init`
- Include necessary directories for handlers, models, repositories, and services
- **Go-Specific Advice**: Use `go mod tidy` to manage dependencies and consider using `wire` for dependency injection if needed.
