# Implement User Profile Management API Endpoints
As a user, I want to update my profile information so that I can keep my details up to date.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use PUT or PATCH endpoints to update user profiles.
- Validate and sanitize input data to prevent SQL injection or other attacks.
- Use middleware for authentication to ensure only authorized users can update their profiles.
