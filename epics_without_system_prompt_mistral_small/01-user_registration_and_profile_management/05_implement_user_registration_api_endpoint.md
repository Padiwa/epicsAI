# Implement User Registration API Endpoint
As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can access the application.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `net/http` package or a router like Chi or Gin to handle HTTP requests.
- Validate user input (e.g., email format, password strength) using a library like `validator`.
- Hash passwords using `bcrypt` before storing them in the database.
