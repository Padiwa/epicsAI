# Set Up Go Project Structure
As a developer, I want to set up a modular Go project structure so that we can organize code effectively.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use a standard Go project layout (e.g., `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `api/`, `models/`).
- Consider using Go modules (`go mod init`) for dependency management.
- Use `go.work` for workspace configuration if working with multiple modules.
