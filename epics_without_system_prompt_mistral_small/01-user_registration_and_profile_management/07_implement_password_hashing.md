# Implement Password Hashing
As a developer, I want to securely hash user passwords so that they are stored safely.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `bcrypt` package to hash passwords with a cost factor (e.g., `bcrypt.DefaultCost`).
- Store the hashed password in the database instead of the plaintext password.
