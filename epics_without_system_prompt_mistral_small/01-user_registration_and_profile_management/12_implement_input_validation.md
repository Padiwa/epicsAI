# Implement Input Validation
As a developer, I want to validate user input so that only valid data is processed.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `validator` package to validate struct fields.
- Return meaningful error messages for invalid input.
- Sanitize input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
