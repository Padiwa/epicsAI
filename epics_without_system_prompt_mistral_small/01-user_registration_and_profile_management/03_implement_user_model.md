# Implement User Model
As a developer, I want to define a User model with essential fields so that user data can be stored and managed.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use structs to represent the User model (e.g., `ID`, `Username`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, `CreatedAt`).
- Consider using GORM for ORM functionality if working with a database.
- Use `time.Time` for timestamps and `uuid` for unique identifiers.
