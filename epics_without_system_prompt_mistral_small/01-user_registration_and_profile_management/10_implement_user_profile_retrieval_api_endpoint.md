# Implement User Profile Retrieval API Endpoint
As a user, I want to view my profile information so that I can see my details.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use GET endpoints to retrieve user profiles.
- Ensure the endpoint is protected by authentication middleware.
- Return user data in JSON format using `encoding/json`.
