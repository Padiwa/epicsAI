# Implement Integration Tests for User Registration and Profile Management
As a developer, I want to write integration tests so that the system works as expected.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `net/http/httptest` package for testing HTTP endpoints.
- Test the entire flow from registration to profile management.
- Use a test database or in-memory database for isolation.
