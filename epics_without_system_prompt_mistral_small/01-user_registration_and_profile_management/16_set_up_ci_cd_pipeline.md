# Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
As a developer, I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline so that changes can be automatically tested and deployed.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for continuous integration.
- Include steps for running tests, building the application, and deploying to a staging environment.
- Use `go build` and `go test` commands in the pipeline.
