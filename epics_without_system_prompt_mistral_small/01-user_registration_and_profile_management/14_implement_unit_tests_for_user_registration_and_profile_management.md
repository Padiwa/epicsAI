# Implement Unit Tests for User Registration and Profile Management
As a developer, I want to write unit tests so that the code is reliable and maintainable.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `testing` package for writing tests.
- Mock database interactions using libraries like `testify/mock`.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.
