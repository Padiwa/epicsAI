# Document the API
As a developer, I want to document the API so that other developers can understand and use it.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use Swagger or OpenAPI for API documentation.
- Include example requests and responses.
- Document the authentication process and error codes.

Each of these tasks is self-contained and can be implemented independently, making it easier for the Go engineering team to prioritize and execute the work.
