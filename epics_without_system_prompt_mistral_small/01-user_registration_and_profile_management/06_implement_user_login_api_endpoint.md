# Implement User Login API Endpoint
As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my profile and training programs.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use sessions or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
- Compare hashed passwords using `bcrypt` during login.
- Return a JWT token upon successful authentication using the `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt` package.
