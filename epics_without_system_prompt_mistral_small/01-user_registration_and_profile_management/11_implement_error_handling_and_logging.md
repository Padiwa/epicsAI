# Implement Error Handling and Logging
As a developer, I want to implement robust error handling and logging so that issues can be diagnosed and fixed.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use the `log` package or a more advanced logging library like `zap`.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).
- Log errors and warnings to a file or external service.
