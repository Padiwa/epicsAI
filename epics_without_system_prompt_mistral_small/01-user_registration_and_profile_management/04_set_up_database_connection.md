# Set Up Database Connection
As a developer, I want to configure a database connection so that the application can persist user data.
**Go-Specific Advice:**
- Use GORM or a similar ORM for database interactions.
- Store database configuration in environment variables (e.g., `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`).
- Use `database/sql` for low-level database operations if not using an ORM.
