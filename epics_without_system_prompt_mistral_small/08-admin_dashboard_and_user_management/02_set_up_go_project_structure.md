# Set Up Go Project Structure

- Create a modular project structure with clear separation of concerns (e.g., `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `api/`, `config/`)
- Implement Go modules for dependency management
- Set up a basic `go.mod` file with appropriate dependencies
- Configure environment variables for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Use Go's standard `os` and `log` packages for basic configuration and logging
